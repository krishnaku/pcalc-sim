class DefaultTransaction(Transaction):
    """
    Represents a transactional context for a signal or series of signal exchanges.

    Transactions allow related signals to be grouped under a shared identifier.
    This is useful for correlating causally linked events (e.g., a request and its response),
    or tracking nested operations in more complex protocols.

    Transactions can be nested via the `parent` field to support hierarchical relationships.

##A domain metamodel for The Presence Calculus

This package defines a metamodel for modeling a domain for the purposes of analyzing flow using The Presence Calculus.

It provides the minimal abstract ontology: Entities, Signals, Transactions, Timelines, DomainEvents, Boundaries,
and Presence that are required  for analyzing flow in any domain.

It is inspired by and compatible with John Hollands Signal/Boundary framework for modeling complex adaptive systems,
but is primarily focused on modeling the physics of flow in such systems: how signals propagate across boundaries,
how presence emerges, and how flow behaviors can be modeled, measured, bounded, and analyzed. For a more detailed
comparison please see [Holland's Signal/Boundary framework](https://github.com/krishnaku/p-calculus-tools/blob/main/docs/holland.md).

Modules in this package enable:

- Construction and identification of domain elements that can flow (entities, signals, transactions)
- Event-driven modeling of signal activity via domain events and timelines
- Defining domain topology using boundaries for determining presence of flow elements in boundaries over time and
thus enabling flow analysis using The Presence Calculus (see package `pcalc`),

This metamodel is intentionally decoupled from any specific domain model. Given any conforming model, it serves as the
bridge for reasoning about flow dynamics using The Presence Calculus (see package `pcalc`),

The first concrete implementation is a simulation framework which can be found in the `sim` package. This allows us to
model and simulate a wide variety of complex adaptive systems: value networks, agent network, queueing systems, value streams etc.
and analyze flow in these systems uniformly via The Presence Calculus.

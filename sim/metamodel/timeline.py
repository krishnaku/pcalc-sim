"""
This module defines the `Timeline`, a runtime record of lifecycle events of elements in a domain.
The timeline captures event history for a domain including signals, timestamps,
source/target entities, and any associated transaction.

The `DomainModel` is the canonical source of truth for the Timeline of a domain.
However, every `Boundary` in the domain has its own timeline that may observe only a
subset of events that occur in the domain.

Analyzing how events propagate across timelines is a first class analysis concern for us.
